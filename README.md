# Object Detection Tutorial
In this tutorial we are going to see how to train and evaluate an object detection model on a custom or standard dataset.

Various trained models on standard datasets are available. But suppose you want to:  
* train your own model on a standard dataset and achieve better results  
or  
* train or fine tune one of the available models on a custom dataset.

In both cases, this tutorial helps you do this with a scientific approach.

What you need to know or study from other sources:
* Python programming
* Working with deep learning frameworks

What we will explore deeply:
* Available models for object detection
* Standard datasets of object detection
* Evaluation metrics

## Aproach
Our approach is to:
* Define the object detection problem.
* Choose one of the available models and evaluate it on the dataset.
* Improve the model.
* Evaluate it again and analyze errors.
