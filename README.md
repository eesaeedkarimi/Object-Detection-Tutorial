# Object Detection Tutorial
In this tutorial we are going to see how to train and evaluate an object detection model on a custom or standard dataset.

Various trained models on standard datasets are available. But suppose you want to  
* train a your own model on a standard dataset and achieve better results  
or  
* train or fine tune one of the available models on a custom dataset.

In both cases this tutorial helps you do this with a scientific approach.
